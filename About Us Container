<h1>Focus of the Camp</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
<p>A student will study 3D object modeling and printing starting with the basics of a 3D printer.  A study of the software needed to communicate between the 3D printer and computer will follow next.    After students learn the fundamentals of printing existing 3D objects, they will practice designing objects made from basic geometric shapes.  </p>
<p>Students will work directly with a 3D printer connected to a personally owned computer or to a computer provided by the College.   At the end of the camp, students will take their 3D printer home with them along with any software loaded onto their personally owned computer.   Each student will also go home with a memory stick containing the software used at the camp.  Students will be provided with PLA for printing 3D objects which is biodegradable and an environmentally friendly plastic.</p>
